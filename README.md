# Prediction of Diabetes Using Classification Algorithms

The aim of project was to predict diabetes based on various parameters of the human body. A dataset consisting of details of the people was divided into Training and Test dataset. To start with, data was explored, preprocessed and visualized. Machine learning models were then applied to the preprocessed data. Trained models were then used to see how well the model performs on unseen data.
